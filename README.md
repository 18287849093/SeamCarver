# SeamCarver
SeamCarver Algorithm written in Python.

## How to run

In order to run this program, you can download anywhere in your device. However the most important thing is to make sure that the image you want to carve is in the same directory as the file. Within the py file, in the main method you need to also change the name of the image that it is taking in to be that of the name of the image you want to carve. 

Once you have it setup to read the correct image, you need to then go into the loop within the main method. Inside that, change the number to be the number of seams that you want to remove. 

## Further information

If you wish to display what the image looks like originally, with the seam that is going to be removed, and what the energy of the pixels looks like you can call the plot_seam() function and these images will display to you.
